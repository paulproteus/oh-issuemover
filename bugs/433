How embarrassing.\n\nI think the best next step is that we actually review phalgun's\nimplementation, and provide feedback.\n\nThanks to all y'all for pinging the bug. It's a pleasure to be part of the\nproject with you folks around!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "phalgun, I see you asked how to add a project.\n\nHere's what you do:\n\n* Log into your personal instance\n\n* View your personal user page\n\n* Click \"Add/edit projects\" in the top right\n\n* Add a project to your personal profile, and save your personal profile\n\nNow, you will be able go from your profile to that project's page.\n\nLet me know if that gives you enough to go on, in order to test your\nchanges!\n\nTwo other hopefully useful pieces of advice:\n\n1. You can often get help with these sorts of questions on #openhatch , the\nIRC channel\n\nIf you're unsure how to join, by all means ask me here! You can find some\ninformation on it in our technical documentation at\n<a href=\"http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/\">http://openhatch.readthedocs.org/</a>\n\n2. You can create Django models via the command line\n\nYou may be familiar with 'python manage.py runserver', which is how to run\nthe web app on your own computer. You can also do\n\npython manage.py shell_plus\n\nand this gives you a Python shell that you can use to interact with the\noh-mainline codebase and database. For example, at that prompt, you can run:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Project.create_dummy(name='My Project')\n\nand that will create a Project object.\n\nYou can see the implementation of create_dummy() in mysite/search/models.py\n\nOne more thing -- I realize it has been ages since you asked your very\nreasonable questions on this ticket! Apologies that it took us so long to\nanswer you well. I'd love to hear from you -- are you still interested in\nworking on this? We'd love it if so!\n\nIf not, then tell us too, and we'll understand.\n\nBest,\n\nAsheesh.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Hello,\n\nI would like to know the current status of this bug.

You can see a demo of that sort of thing here: \n<a href=\"http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay/index.html\">http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay/index.html</a>\n\nIf you happen to like JavaScript, this actually be pretty easy. You'll\nhave to remove some \"chrome\" (site layout), which will require a little \ntemplate wrangling. That part gets less bitesized, and involves some CSS \nwork.\n\nThis is pretty well-defined and would make a good first bug for someone with \nJavaScript skills and a Django template background.
