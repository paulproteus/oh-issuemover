I'm fairly new to OH and would like to help out :)\n\nI had a look at this bug, and this is what I found: if you use tar zcvf \nmyproject-0.1.tar.gz myproject-0.1 to create the tarball, your tar file has this \nsort of file/folder structure:\nmyproject-0.1.tar.gz/myproject-0.1/&lt;filename&gt;\n\nIf, on the other hand, you use tar zcvf myproject-0.1.tar.gz ./myproject-0.1, you \nwould get the same files (Makefile, hello.c) into the tarball as the previous \nmethod, but the folder structure in the tarball is different:\nmyproject-0.1.tar.gz/./myproject-0.1/&lt;filename&gt;\n\nSo while the commands are basically the same, they produce slightly different \ntarballs. For the purposes of the training mission it probably doesn't matter too \nmuch, but I feel that in practice you usually don't see tarballs that have \".\" as \nthe top-level folder, so I would say that this is not a bug. What do you think?\n   \n", "author": "tianyupu"}, {"message": "I'm away from my main computer, so I can't easily reproduce and/or fix \nthis issue, but I want to quickly reply to say:\n\nYou have done an amazing job of explaining how to reproduce the issue you \nare seeing.
