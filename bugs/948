To fix that, we should recommend \"curl\" instead, \nwhich most GNU/Linux users will have, and is standard on Mac OS, and comes with \nGit Bash.\n\nThis ticket tracks the of reviewing all the mission steps within \n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch\">https://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch</a> and finding the places where they \nrecommend \"wget\" (look in the hints box, and check the \"High\" hint level \nespecially!), converting them to use \"curl -O\" (dash capital o), and testing \nthose command lines to make sure they work properly.\n\nOnce we do this, more Windows and Mac users will have an easy time learning via \nthe tar training mission.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
