(Look in the docs about how to import a data snapshot. Also, doing that \nimport can take 20-60 minutes.)\n\nThe code for this *probably* is mysite/search/views.py , the search_index() \nfunction. It is one seriously long function, but with any luck you won't have to \nunderstand all of it.\n\nDo look at the template, too! That's mysite/search/templates/search/search.html \n. The quickest way to solve this is probably to:\n\n* Look at the template, and understand what variable name is being passed into \nthe template\n\n* Look in the function, and figure out what is filling out that variable\n\n* See if you can fix the issue by adding a call to .order_by() something... \nmaybe order_by('name') or order_by('project__name').\n\nMarking as bitesize, but this is sort of mouthful size.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Adding bitesize keyword because this is likely pretty simple.\n\nIt would be nice if a patch for this came with a test, but I can probably live \nwithout it.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "soonick5, reading your suggestion here, yes, sorting by name makes sense to me. \nSorry about the long delay.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Hello,\n\nDo we want just a label saying how we are sorting them or should we sort them by\nname (which I think makes more sense)?\n\nRegards\n   \n", "author": "soonick5"}, {"message": "To reproduce:\n\n1.
