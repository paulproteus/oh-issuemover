We made a draft web app--the buildhelper tab on OpenHatch project \npages--that makes a checklist for prospective contributors, so they can go \nthrough the steps one by one. Right now, there's no way to write or edit these \nchecklists, though. What this bug will do is implement editing with the \nbuildhelper data living inside one large textarea, with a standard text-based \nformat. \n\nThis bug would be good for someone who thinks it'd be fun to try to convert user-\ninputted text to and from Django ORM objects. As for what format the buildhelper \ntext ought to have, we were thinking something vaguely MediaWiki-ish; ask Asheesh \nfor more details on that.\n   \n", "author": "aldeka"}, {"message": "In 0.11.10, we'll do this with a &lt;textarea&gt;.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Aldeka, what is the buildhelper? - &amp; can we get some better descriptions related to <a href=\"issue212\">issue212</a>, \n<a href=\"issue204\">issue204</a> &amp; <a href=\"issue210\">issue210</a>.\n   \n", "author": "palhmbs"}]}
