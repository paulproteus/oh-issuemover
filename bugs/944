Following @brittag's suggestion, I\nchecked a few blog posts that used the same &lt;h3&gt; tags that could do with a\nboldening of the title. So I located the common &lt;h3&gt; that could affect all these\nposts at \"mysite/static/css/blog-style.css\". I added an extra \"font-weight:\nbold\" at line 221. I have submitted a merge request on Github as per the\nguidelines. Could you please take a look and review the change. \n\nMy earlier comment about blog-style.css not being the correct file was incorrect\n(Sincere apologies!)\n\nP.S. This is my first time contributing to an open source project. Thx for all\nthe help. :)\n   \n", "author": "hermitnoon"}, {"message": "One \"simple\" way to address this problem is to see if the &lt;body&gt; element \non blog pages have a particular class.\n\nThen you could override H3's style just for that one class.\n\nI can clarify more if needed!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Thanks for looking into this, hermitnoon!\n\nIt looks like this part of the CSS is controlled by the site-wide stylesheets instead of the blog-\nspecific stylesheets. See here: <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/static/less/base/base.less\">http://openhatch.org/static/less/base/base.less</a> - h3 { margin-\nbottom: 0px; text-align: left; clear: left; font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.1em; color: @default-\ntext-color; letter-spacing: 0; margin: 0; }\n\nI figured this out because when I clicked \"inspect element\" in Chrome to look at this h3, the source \nof the styling appeared to be the page itself instead of an external CSS file - and I remembered that \nOpenHatch uses \"less\" - so some external CSS files get loaded into the page with JavaScript. So I \nlooked at the \"less\" files at the top of the page HTML and found the one that had the right h3 \nstyling.\n\nI don't know if simply changing that h3 styling will cause problems elsewhere on the OpenHatch site \nthough - that sounds like something to investigate. :)\n   \n", "author": "brittag"}, {"message": "Could someone help me locate the CSS file for the blog.
