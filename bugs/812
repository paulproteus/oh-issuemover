Here are the problems and the steps to reproduce them:\n\n1. If you go to the Low hint of the \"Patching individual files\" section of the\ndiffpatch mission, you see that the description of the Low hint is not clear, as\nthe man command does not work on Windows. The description could be clearer.\n\n2. \"Diffing individual files\"- the description of the Low hint is clear and\nconcise but links to the wrong man page(the man page of patch, when it is\nsupposed to link to the man page of diff) and it also specifies the wrong man\ncommand. It is supposed to say \"man diff\", and not \"man patch\". Low hint also\nhas a formatting problem, that is, the first line of the Low hint is way off to\nthe right.\n\n3. \"Diffing entire directories\"- Low hint description could be clearer, links to\nthe wrong man page, and specifies the wrong man command.\n\n4. \"Patching entire directories\" - Low hint description could be clearer.\nEverything else with this section of diffpatch is good.\n\nI checked all of the other training missions and the formatting problem\nmentioned above in 2 is found in the \"Using tar\" mission too.\n\nI was able to reproduce these problems on Linux Mint 16 and Mac OSX.\nI am working on a patch to solve the problems mentioned above.\n   \n", "author": "eeshangarg"}, {"message": "Clarified usage instructions for man patch.\n   \n", "author": "mbirdi"}, {"message": "This could probably be (temporarily) solved by telling them to do patch --help. \nHowever, in the long term I suggest switching to Cyguin (discuss!)\n   \n", "author": "Coffeeman"}, {"message": "I ran into this issue using GitBash version 1.8.1.2\n   \n", "author": "brifelix"}, {"message": "On <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/single_patch\">http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/single_patch</a> in the Low level hint, it says to use \"man \npatch\" to get more information about the patch tool.\n\n\"man\" doesn't come with git bash, so I'm unable to run that command.\n\nI am using Windows 7, and just installed the latest version of git bash from their website.\n   \n", "author": "jesstess"}]}
