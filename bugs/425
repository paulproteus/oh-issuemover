We tried to duplicate it \nconsistently but failed. It just happened to me so I thought I'd note the path for \nsomeone else. It's really fun :)\n\nAttached is screenshot of the oddness on Windows 7 Chrome.\n\n1. Go to your edit profile page: <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/profile/views/edit_info\">http://openhatch.org/profile/views/edit_info</a> . I \nadded some to the \"I understand:\" field.\n2. Click save.\n3. Click \"home\" (upper left of nav to take you to logged-in user home/landing page)\n4. Bugs should be taking a while to load/recalculate. The page is probably looking \na little like the attached screenshot.\n5. If you hit reload, things will go back to rightness.\n\nWas able to reproduce this on Firefox 3.6.17 on Win 7 as well.\n   \n", "author": "jessica"}]}
