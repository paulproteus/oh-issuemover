This is indeed an important issue.\n\nSome possible approaches to fix this:\n- Make the e-mail field for registration a requirement and make sure it is \nalways public, at least for the OpenHatch registered users. (Cons: privacy, \nPros: easy to implement)\n- If people mark themselves as \"want to help\" and they haven't setted the \"how \nto contact\" field, they should get a warning that there's no way for people to \ncontact them. (Cons: people could forget, Pros: keeps privacy and it's fairly \neasy to implement)\n- Implement an OpenHatch messaging system. (Cons: hard to implement, Pros: a \nnatural and complete solution)\n\nThe first two are perhaps the best call for now since implementing a messaging \nsystem is hard and could take a long time.\n\nJust having a \"contact this user\" with forwarder, visible at least to mentors, \nwould help tremendously.\n   \n", "author": "vkmc"}, {"message": "This is a really important issue, and (UNKNOWN CHARACTER)I hope we can get to it soon.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "Adding myself to the cc: list, OpenStack Horizon currently has 6 people who\nindicated they want to help but no way to contact them and it'd be awesome to\nhave a way to let them know! :)\n\nPerhaps in the meantime, it would be possible to show a message to the user\nafter they click the button? To remind them to check that their profile contains\nsome way to contact them, and perhaps also thank them for their interest.\n   \n", "author": "jpichon"}, {"message": "We can use the forwarder system, probably.\n\nThis solves the use case where:\n\n* Project (in this case Mifos) gets an email with a person who is interested in \nhelping\n\n* That person hasn't listed how to contact them\n\n* Therefore, the nice Mifos people can't reach the OpenHatch site visitor who \nwants to help Mifos\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
