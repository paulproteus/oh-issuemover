A discussion on IRC suggests this functionality would \nbe useful.  (See <a href=\"http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2014-05-\">http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2014-05-</a>\n27#i_3366800)\n   \n", "author": "shauna"}, {"message": "Changing this bug with Asheesh's permission to expand it a bit.\n\nThis bug now covers creating a new class of people called \"ambassadors\".  A user\ncan flag themselves as an ambassador for a project.  If they are marked as such,\nthey will be notified whenever a user clicks on the big green button for that\nproject.  Notification will be done by email.  The email will contain a message\nabout why the email was sent, a link to un-ambassador, a link to the OpenHatch\nsite where an email address for the user can be found, and perhaps some\nsuggestions on what to do with this information.\n\nChanges that need to happen:\n\n1. On <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/+portfolio/editor/,\">https://openhatch.org/+portfolio/editor/,</a> the user will be able to click a\ncheckbox labeled, \"I'm an ambassador for this project!\".  Clicking on this\ncheckbox and saving the project information makes this user an ambassador for\nthat project.  There should be some help text available telling the user what it\nmeans to be an ambassador.  Either that can be done by linking the word\n\"ambassador\" or having a ? link or however it is that sort of thing happens on\nOpenHatch.\n\n2. (optional) On <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/people/willkahngreene/,\">https://openhatch.org/people/willkahngreene/,</a> for any projects\nthe user is an ambassador for, text along the lines of \"I am an ambassador\"\nshould appear.\n\n(alternative) Add a \"I am an ambassador\" text to the info column on the left\nside that lists projects the user is an ambassador for.\n\n3. When a user clicks on the big green button, an email is sent to all\nambassadors for that project along the lines of:\n\n\"\"\"\nHi!\n\nPERSON has expressed an interest in helping out with project XYZ by clicking on\nthe big green button.  You can contact PERSON at this link:\n\n&lt;link to profile page&gt;\n\nContact PERSON and introduce yourself.  Then help PERSON get involved in project\nXYZ.  &lt;insert advice here&gt;\n\nYou have elected to be an ambassador for project XYZ and that's why you're\nreceiving this email.  If you no longer want to be an ambassador, then\n&lt;instructions here to remove ambassador flag&gt;.\n\nRock on!\n\nOpenHatch - making FLOSS development rock!\n\"\"\"\n\n\nI think that's all that's needed.  I haven't looked at the OH code, so I have no\nidea if this is doable as it stands, or needs some augmentation.\n   \n", "author": "willkahngreene"}, {"message": "Right now, it's not clear on the site if you're \"Mentor\" for \"Python\", is that\nthe skill or the project? And we don't really say what to do with people who\nwant to offer themselves as mentors in a project.\n\nWe should solve that.\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}]}
