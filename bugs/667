Then even if you change that to page source, you get \nprompted again to append \".txt\" to the file name. You must choose \"Don't Append\" to get the \ndesired result.\n\nI updated the instructions on the wiki instructing the user to right click the link directly and choose \na \"Save As\" option. I used the text from 4 different current browsers in the instructions (Safari on \nMavericks, Firefox on Mavericks, Chrome on Mavericks, and Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8).\n\nThe alternatives would be to host the file on a server where we could control the server's response \nheaders and set the content disposition header.

When right-clicked and \"Saved As...\", \nthe file is renamed from \"nobel.py\" to \"nobel.py.txt\".\n\nLater in step 4 ( CLI: \"python nobel.py\" ), the filename doesn't match, \nand a student was observed to be visibly confused.\n\nI think this might be a server side issue over at the mit.edu server \nwhere the script is stored, which is running Apache. So, this might be \nfixable with a custom .htaccess file in\n <a href=\"http://mit.edu/jesstess/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/\">http://mit.edu/jesstess/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/</a>\n\nI think this has to do with \"Content-Disposition\".\n\nAnother solution might be to move the file to openhatch.org (for example \nto \"/var/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/pyfiles/\"), where you have the \nliberty of configuring nginx.conf with per-directory custom Content-\nDisposition header:\n\nlocation /files/BostonPythonWorkshop5/ {\n        root /var/www/BostonPythonWorkshop5/pyfiles/;\n        add_header Content-Disposition 'attachment;\n    }\n\nOr something like that.
