There seem\nto be two issues here:\n\n1) Bugs that are marked \"Status: closed\" are not being removed from our bug\ncollection. There's lots of them that have been closed for a while (1+ months)\nbut we still display. This may be a separate issue.\n\n2) I think I've confused the two separate fields of \"Status\" vs. \"Stage\". We are\npulling the former, not the latter (oops -.-). It shouldn't be too painful to\ngrab the stage info; indeed, it should already be present in the metadata\ndictionary from the parse. (bugimporters/roundup.py:111) So the question then is\nhow to deal with this specifically in the Python tracker case without making any\ngroundbreaking changes---it would be nice to not have to add a configuration\nsetting for a stage, e.g.\n\nI propose to replace the \"Status\" value with the \"Stage\" value if \"Status\" ==\nopen. This has the added benefit of better UX for those browsing in our\nvolunteer opportunities search, as they get more information about the bug\nstatus at a glance without having to open the issue. To accomplish this, all\nthat needs to be done is an override of a small piece of functionality in\nget_parsed_data_dict for the roundup trackers (line 197).\n   \n", "author": "ehashman"}, {"message": "I accidentally put the status change on the wrong comment, sorry! :)\n\nOn 2014-04-04 09:14, ehashman wrote:\n&gt; ehashman &lt;<a href=\"mailto:elana@hashman.ca\">elana@hashman.ca</a>&gt; added the comment:\n&gt;\n&gt; I've refiled the second half of the bug report as <a href=\"issue953\">issue 953</a>:\n&gt; <a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue953\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue953</a>\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------\n&gt; status: chatting -&gt; need-review\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________\n&gt; Roundup issue tracker &lt;<a href=\"mailto:bugs@openhatch.org\">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt;\n&gt; &lt;<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue906\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue906</a>&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; Devel mailing list\n&gt; <a href=\"mailto:Devel@lists.openhatch.org\">Devel@lists.openhatch.org</a>\n&gt; <a href=\"http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/devel\">http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/devel</a>\n   \n", "author": "ehashman"}, {"message": "I've refiled the second half of the bug report as <a href=\"issue953\">issue 953</a>:\n<a href=\"https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue953\">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue953</a>\n   \n", "author": "ehashman"}, {"message": "Verified that the bug still exists (this bug comes up in a search even though\nit's in review: <a href=\"http://bugs.python.org/issue9305\">http://bugs.python.org/issue9305</a> and this one is\ncommitted/rejected: <a href=\"http://bugs.python.org/issue20145\">http://bugs.python.org/issue20145</a>).\n\nFix for this is to change \"closed\" to \"closed,resolved,patch\nreview,committed/rejected\" in the Python tracker configuration in\nopenhatch.org/customs, which I've done.
