Only the OH project page has this \nBuildHelper tab.\n\nThis task will be a 3-step code removal process:\n1. Remove the front-end html/css.\n2. Do a south migration to delete any buildhelper data.\n3. Finally, remove any .py files in the models and views that mention the buildhelper.\n\nThis commit achieves the first step.\n   \n", "author": "onceuponatimeforever"}, {"message": "See remarks on pull request; it's getting there!\n   \n", "author": "paulproteus"}, {"message": "PR is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/212\">https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/pull/212</a> I like removing code!\n   \n", "author": "onceuponatimeforever"}, {"message": "If you look at <a href=\"http://openhatch.org/projects/openhatch,\">http://openhatch.org/projects/openhatch,</a> you will see there is a \ntabbed interface in the corner to let users choose between \"Q&amp;A\" and \n\"Buildhelper\".\n\nWe haven't worked on the \"Buildhelper\" part of the site in ages, so let's remove \nthe Buildhelper tab from the project page template.
