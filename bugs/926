I also took a screenshot of the\nfooter, where I changed the background to a flat color. I hope you can evaluate\nthe situation based on the screenshots. IMO Tuffy doesn't look so bad, but I\nguess Fira Sans looks cleaner.\n\nNote that the font in the tweet stream (Gotham Narrow) comes from Twitter.\n\nFira Sans can be found here:\n<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/\">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/</a>\n   \n", "author": "Beluga"}, {"message": "At <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7161306\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7161306</a> a site visitor mentions that the \ndefault font, Tuffy, seems to not look good on Windows.
