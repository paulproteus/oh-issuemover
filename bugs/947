The current edit profile page is aesthetically un-appealing, time-consuming to \ncomplete, and has CSS flaws.\n\nEven though I'm not a designer or artist, I can see room for improvement on this page. \n\nThere are some obvious glaring CSS flaws that should really be fixed, as shown in the attached \nscreenshot: \n1. the instructional text don't line up in the same line \n2 the save and cancel button are not on the same line \n \nSome design-related proposals: \n1. Most of the instructional text are located on the right side of the box. Instead, I think the page \nlooks better if the text are placed directly above the form boxes or are used as text placeholders \nwithin the box itself. \n2. The page looks long and time-consuming to complete, which is possibly bad for bounce rate \nand user engagement. We can shorten the page by reducing the size of the form boxes. \n\nI'm free to discuss with anyone interested in design stuff as it relates to this ticket on IRC.
